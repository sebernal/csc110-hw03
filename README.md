# Homework Assignment 3: Conditionals

**Due: As listed on course schedule**

*Note: Homework Assignment 3 should be completed individually.*


# Objective
The theme of this homework is a "grade" calculator.

So far, we have trusted that the user will input the desired type of values when we request them to do so. We will now do some basic input checking to see if the input that the user provided is adequate for the task. There will be a little bit about loops in this homework, but the template already contains the loop structure, so you only need to worry about the steps that are required for each loop iteration.

For this homework you need to complete three tasks:

1) Make the `read_five_ints` function with input checking for each requested number.
2) Make the `pick_averaging_method` function with input checking for the requested option.
3) Make the `pick_visualization` function with input checking for the requested option.

So you understand what we are shooting for, an example run looks like this:
```
Give me the next grade in [0 to 10]:8
Give me the next grade in [0 to 10]:6
Give me the next grade in [0 to 10]:10
Give me the next grade in [0 to 10]:7
Give me the next grade in [0 to 10]:6
Sorted grades: [6, 6, 7, 8, 10]
Pick 'a' for mean, 'b' for median, 'c' for mode: b
picked: Median
Pick '1' for print average, or '2' for plot average: 2
Annotated grades:
 6  6 (7)8 10
The End
```

You only need to complete the functions. The `main` is provided for you and it takes care of all the printouts except the error messages we require you to print (more on that below).
In particular, it takes care of sorting the input grades and printing the desired formatted results. **We only care about detecting mistakes in the user input choices.**

The DocStrings below every function explain what they do. Do not remove them.

# A Note on passing the tests

Any tests are very strict with respect to the format of requested prompts and printouts so pay attention to exactly what is requested and replicate it as exactly as possible.

## The global variable `grades`

The list variable `grades` is declred at the top and outside any function. This makes it a member of the **global context** and visible to all functions.

  * This variable is initialized with 5 zeros inside.
  * If you modify this list while inside any function, the global variable will be modified. However, you *need* to tell pythn that you intend to use the `global grades` so make sure you put that at the top of the function.
  * You can overwrite a value at some index `idx` with the number `num` by using the command:
    ```
    grades[idx] = num
    ```
  * remember that the only valid indices that you can use for the variable `grades` are 0 through 4 (because we only havea total of 5).

## Task 1: read_five_ints

### define the function

The objective of this function is to read five inputs from the user, cast them to integers, and use them to update the list.

**Tip**: To check if an input string (let's call it `in_str`) is composed of digits, you can use this notation:
```
in_str.isdigit()
```

  * This returns `True` if `in_str` is composed of only digits e.g. `"123"` or `"0107"`.
  * This returns `False` if `in_str` is not composed of only digits e.g. `"123.7"` (note the dot) or `"01 7"` (note the space), or `"02q5"`.

The steps to complete the function are detailed below:

  1. Remove the `pass` keyword indside the provided for loop and fill it out with your code.
  2. You should use the `input` function to read one number using the following prompt: `"Give me the next grade in [0 to 10]:"`; Note that whatever is read is a String.
  3. Check to see if the input is only digits. If it is not, print an error message with: `"Error in read_five_ints: input string is not for an integer"` and follow that with the statement `exit()`.
  4. If the string has only digits, cast the input string into an integer by using the `int` function.
  5. If the resulting integer is not inside the interval [0,10] (between 0 and 10 inclusive), you should print an error message with: `"Error in read_five_ints: input integer outside of range"` and follow that with the statement `exit()`.
  6. If the integer is in the correct interval, overwrite the grade at index `idx` with the integer read from the user (that means writing to the grades list like this `grades[idx] = num`).
  7. After the loop is done, the grades should only have the 5 integers provided by the user.
  8. Remember, after modifying `grades` for all indices, you are done, you don't need to return anything (because the grades list is global).

### Testing

This is a good point to run the tests and check to see if this function works as indicated (task1 tests), for both correct inputs or incorrect ones (two types of incorrect inputs).

Note that for the tests, we do not compare against the prompts and user input, only the printouts.

## Task 2: pick_averaging_method

### define the function

The purpose of pick_averaging_method is to pick one of three standard averaging methods: mean, median, or mode. Mean is the standard arithmetic average we are used to, e.g. the mean of `[6,6,7,8,10]` is 7.4; median is the value at the center of the provided values if they are aranged in a sorted list, e.g. the median of `[6,6,7,8,10]` is 7, and the median of `[6,6,7,8]` is 6.5 (in the middle between 6 and 7); Lastly, the mode is the most repeated value, e.g. the mode of `[6,6,7,8,10]` is 6, and the mode of `[6,6,7,8,8]` is 6 (in case of a tie, it's the first one);


You need to do the following:

  1. remove the `pass` keyword and instead:
  2. get a string input from the user, using the prompt `"Pick 'a' for mean, 'b' for median, 'c' for mode: "`.
  3. Use a multi-path conditional to decide one of the following options:
     1. if the user input `"a"`, print the message
        ```
        picked: Mean
        ```
        then calculate the mean by using the command:
        ```
        avg = statistics.mean(grades)
        ```
        and return the obtained value.
     1. if the user input `"b"`, print the message
        ```
        picked: Median
        ```
        then calculate the mean by using the command:
        ```
        avg = statistics.median(grades)
        ```
        and return the obtained value.
      1. if the user input `"c"`, print the message
        ```
        picked: Mode
        ```
        then calculate the mean by using the command:
        ```
        avg = statistics.mode(grades)
        ```
        and return the obtained value.

     4. Otherwise, print an error message with: `"Error in pick_averaging_method: incorrect option picked"` and follow that with the statement `exit()`.


### Testing

This is a good point to run the tests and check to see if this function works as indicated, for both correct inputs or incorrect ones (only one type of error here).

## Task 3: pick_visualization

### define the function

The purpose of pick_visualization is to print the average result in one of two ways, depending on user input. If the user picks option 1, the simple average is printed after the list, and if option 2 is picked, a "fancy" version of the list items is printed out, with annotations to indicate where the average is located.

You need to do the following:

  1. remove the `pass` keyword and instead:
  2. get a string input from the user, using the prompt `"Pick '1' for print average, or '2' for plot average: "`.
  3. if the user input `"1"`, you should simply call the provided function **print_list_and_average** with the call `print_list_and_average(average)`. This will take care of printing the message (placeholders in use):\
    ```The average <[list printed here]> is <average>```\
    see the examples shown below.
  4. if the user input `"2"`, you should simply call the provided function **plot_grades** with the call: `plot_grades(average)`.
  5. Otherwise, print an error message with: `"Error in pick_visualization: incorrect option picked"` and follow that with the statement `exit()`.

### Testing

This is a good point to run the tests and check to see if this function works as indicated, for both correct inputs or incorrect ones (only one type of error here).
